#Number Guessing Game 🎮
##Overview
Welcome to my Number Guessing Game! This is a fun, interactive web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, marking a significant milestone in my JavaScript learning journey. As a graphic designer and video editor, I’m thrilled to blend my design skills with coding to create an engaging user experience. This game challenges players to guess a random number between 1 and 20, with dynamic feedback and a polished UI.
Key Highlights:

Built from scratch with clean, modular code.
Features a zoom animation and responsive design.
Reflects my growth in DOM manipulation and event handling.

##Features

Dynamic Gameplay: Guess a number and get instant feedback (too high, too low, or correct).
Interactive UI: Includes a "Check" button to submit guesses and an "Again!" button to reset the game.
Visual Feedback: 
Background turns green on a win and red on a loss.
"Again!" button zooms with a CSS animation.


Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile with centered elements and adjusted sizes.
Score System: 
Start with a score of 20.
Gain +2 points for correct guesses.
Lose -1 or -2 points for incorrect guesses.
Track your highscore.


Robust Code: Uses "use strict" for reliable JavaScript and clear event listeners.

##My JavaScript Journey
This game is a proud milestone in my journey as a web developer. As a graphic designer and video editor from Pakistan, I’ve loved combining my design skills with coding to create a clean, engaging UI. Building this game taught me:

**DOM manipulation:** Updating elements like score and messages.
**Event listeners:** Handling button clicks and input.
**CSS animations:** Creating the zoom effect for the "Again!" button.
**Debugging:** Fixing issues like score display and mobile layout (e.g., overflow).

I’m excited to keep learning and building! Check out my portfolio for more of my work in design and development.
