# Number Guessing Game üéÆ
## Overview
Welcome to my Number Guessing Game! This is a fun, interactive web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, marking a significant milestone in my JavaScript learning journey. As a front-end web designer, I‚Äôm thrilled to blend my design skills with coding to create an engaging user experience. This game challenges players to guess a random number between 1 and 20, with dynamic feedback and a polished UI.
Key Highlights:

Built from scratch with clean, modular code.
Features a zoom animation and responsive design.
Reflects my growth in DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features

- Dynamic Gameplay: Guess a number and get instant feedback (too high, too low, or correct).
- Interactive UI: Includes a "Check" button to submit guesses and an "Again!" button to reset the game.
- Visual Feedback: 
Background turns green on a win and red on a loss.
- "Again!" button zooms with a CSS animation.


- Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile with centered elements and adjusted sizes.
## Score System: 
- Start with a score of 20.
- Gain +2 points for correct guesses.
- Lose -1 or -2 points for incorrect guesses.
- Track your highscore.


Robust Code: Uses "use strict" for reliable JavaScript and clear event listeners.
